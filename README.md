What does it do?
This workflow automates Gmail attachment management to Google Drive:

Triggers on new unread Gmail messages (checks every minute)
Downloads attachments from emails
Categorizes attachments by type (files, images, videos)
Organizes in Google Drive by:

Creating a folder named after the sender's email
Creating subfolders: "files", "images", and "videos"
Uploading attachments to the appropriate subfolder


Marks emails as read after processing
Handles existing folders - checks if sender folders already exist before creating new ones

The workflow processes attachments intelligently, creating the folder structure only when needed.
